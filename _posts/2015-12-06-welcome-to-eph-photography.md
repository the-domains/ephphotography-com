# WELCOME TO EPH PHOTOGRAPHY

When I hear the word "portrait" the first image that comes to mind is the traditional family photo. You know the one -- Mom, Dad, two point five kids -- all dressed the same and lined up by height in front of the mantle. We've all seen them and more often than not, they aren't very memorable. That's not my style.

I want to create something different for you, something memorable and truly unique.

I know your time is important and that's why I offer an efficient shoot without sacrificing quality, in a variety of packages options.

When the time comes to capture that special moment in your life, whatever it may be, I use my unique perspective to frame your world and translate that moment into a single stunning image.

It's the way I see things...
